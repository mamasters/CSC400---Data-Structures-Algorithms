# CSC400---Data-Structures-Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms will focus on understanding key concepts related to data structures and the analysis of algorithms. The topics presented in this course will range from introducing abstract data types (ADTs) such as bags, stacks, queues, deques, and priority queues, to further analyzing the efficiency associated with the ADTS and other algorithms.

## Module 2 Critial Thinking Assignment - Java Bag Data Structure
1. Design a Java class called Bag that implements the bag data structure.

2. The Bag class should have the following methods:
  - void add(T item): This method should add an item of type T to the bag.
  - void remove(T item): This method should remove one occurrence of the item from the bag, if it exists.
   - boolean contains(T item): This method should return true if the item exists in the bag; otherwise, it should return false.   

3. Write a Java program that demonstrates the usage of the Bag class. Your program should perform the following operations:
  - Create an instance of the Bag class.
  - Add several elements to the bag, including duplicates.
  - Print the bag contents.
  - Test the contains method for a few elements.
  - Test the count method for a few elements.
  - Remove an element from the bag.
  - Print the bag contents again
  - Test the contains method for the removed element.
  - Test the count method for the removed element.
  - Comment your code appropriately to explain the functionality of each method

## Module 4 Critial Thinking Assignment - Postifx Calculator
Implement a postfix calculator in Java that evaluates arithmetic expressions in postfix notation. The program should support the basic arithmetic operations:
  - addition (+)
  - subtraction (-)
  - multiplication (*)
  - two division operations:  (/ and %)
  - Additionally, the program should handle operands and display the final result.
  - Your program should also be able to read a text file containing several expressions. Implement a function in your program to read each expression and evaluate it.

## Module 5 Critical Thinking Assignment - Radix Sort Algorithm
  - Implement the radix sort algorithm in Java.
  - Analyze your algorithm in Big-Oh notation and provide the appropriate analysis.
  - Analyze the algorithm by documenting the steps taken when radix sort sorts the following array of Integer objects: 783 99 472 182 264 543 356 295 692 491 94
  - Analyze the Big-O of your algorithm.
